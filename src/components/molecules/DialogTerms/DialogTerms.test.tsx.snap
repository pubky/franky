          Covered Claims:
          <br />
          Except for excluded claims described in the paragraph below, Synonym and you each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (i) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, (ii) Platform; (iii) your Content or (iii) your use of the Platform at any time, will be subject to and finally resolved by confidential, binding arbitration on an individual basis and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. If you are a Person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States of America, the interpretation and enforceability of this arbitration provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq. Arbitration will be conducted through the use of videoconferencing technology (unless both parties agree that an in-person hearing is appropriate given the nature of the dispute) before a single arbitrator in accordance with the CPR Rules. The sole arbitrator must be a legal practitioner in the El Salvador with at least fifteen (15) years of experience in commercial disputes, that holds a current practising certificate. If an arbitrator cannot be jointly appointed by the arbitration parties within thirty (30) days of the commencement of the arbitration, an arbitrator meeting the above qualifications will be selected by the International Institute for Conflict Prevent and Resolution. Judgement upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. If the arbitral parties do not promptly agree on the seat of arbitration if an in-person hearing is selected, the seat will be El Salvador. The language of the arbitral proceedings will be English. No discovery shall be conducted except by agreement of the parties or after approval by the arbitrator, who shall attempt to minimize the burden of discovery. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by Laws, and the arbitral decision may be enforced in court. For claims less than U.S.$15,000, Synonym will reimburse you for all initiating filing fees in the event that the claim is successful. The prevailing party, as determined by the arbitrator, will be entitled to its costs of the arbitration (including the arbitrator’s fees) and its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

          Excluded Claims:
          <br />
          The following claims and causes of action will be excluded from arbitration as described in the paragraph above: causes of action or claims in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of its intellectual property or its confidential information or private data. The Parties shall be at liberty to pursue claims or causes of actions excluded from arbitration through any court of competent jurisdiction.

          Delegation:
          <br />
          The arbitrator will have the power to hear and determine challenges to its jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the formation, existence, scope, enforceability or validity of the arbitration agreement. This authority extends to jurisdictional challenges with respect to both the subject matter of the dispute and the parties to the arbitration. Further, the arbitrator will have the power to determine the existence, validity, or scope of the contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part. For the purposes of challenges to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, each clause in this section will be considered as separable from any contract of which it forms a part. Any challenges to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, except challenges based on the award itself, will be made not later than the notice of defense or, with respect to a counterclaim, the reply to the counterclaim; provided, however, that if a claim or counterclaim is later added or amended such a challenge may be made not later than the response to such claim or counterclaim as provided under CPR Rules.

No adjudicator may consolidate or join more than one Person’s or Party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.

          Governing law:
          <br />
          These Terms shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of El Salvador and shall be interpreted in all respects as a El Salvador contract. Any transaction, dispute, controversy, claim or action arising from or related to your access to the Platform or these Terms shall be governed by the Laws of El Salvador, exclusive of choice-of-law principles.

          No Waiver; Available Remedies:
          <br />
          Any failure by Synonym to exercise any of its rights, powers, or remedies under these Terms, or any delay by Synonym in doing so, does not constitute a waiver of any such right, power, or remedy. The single or partial exercise of any right, power, or remedy by Synonym does not prevent either from exercising any other rights, powers, or remedies. The remedies of Synonym are cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by the provisions of these Terms, or by law or equity. You agree that the remedies to which Synonym is entitled include (i) injunctions to prevent breaches of these Terms and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, and you waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with such remedies, (ii) the right to recover the amount of any Losses by set off against any amounts that Synonym would otherwise be obligated to pay to you, and (iii) the right to seize and recover against any of your assets, or your interests therein, that are held by Synonym or any of its Associates.

          These Terms, and any of the rights, duties, and obligations contained or incorporated herein, are not assignable by you without prior written consent of Synonym and any attempt by you to assign these Terms without Synonym’s written consent is void. These Terms, and any of the rights, duties, and obligations contained herein, are freely assignable by Synonym, in whole or in part, without notice or your consent (for clarity, this assignment right includes the right for Synonym to assign any claim, in whole or in part, arising hereunder).

Subject to the foregoing, these Terms, and any of the rights, duties, and obligations contained or incorporated herein, shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, personal or legal representatives, successors and assigns of you and of Synonym. None of the provisions of these Terms, or any of the rights, duties, and obligations contained or incorporated herein, are for the benefit of or enforceable by any creditors of you or Synonym or any other persons, except: (i) such as inure to a successor or assign in accordance herewith; and (ii) that the Associates of Synonym are intended third party beneficiaries of the rights and privileges expressly stated to apply to the Associates hereunder and shall be entitled to enforce such rights and privileges (including those rights and privileges set out in the paragraph titled “Responsibilities, Limitation of Liability and Indemnity”) as if a direct party to these Terms. No consent of any Person is required for any modification or amendment to these Terms.
