          NOTICE AT COLLECTION
          <br />
          We collect, and in the past 12 months have collected, the following categories of information from and about you: identifiers (such as your public key, IP address, account identifiers and cryptographic keys), internet or similar network activity (such as device information, log data, and usage information) and communications (where you contact us directly). We collect these categories of information from you in order to provide our services to you, to run our business, to communicate with you, and as required by law. We may have disclosed each of these categories of personal information for a business purpose as described below. We have not “sold” or “shared” personal information in the past 12 months, as those terms are defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) or General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). For a description of your rights under the CCPA or GDPR, and instructions on how to exercise your rights, please see the Your Privacy Rights section below.

        <p
          class="text-muted-foreground text-base font-normal"
          data-testid="typography"
        >
          We will retain each of these categories of personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. Retention periods are determined based on: (i) duration of the user relationship; (ii) legal and regulatory requirements; (iii) security and fraud-prevention needs; and (iv) dispute resolution obligations. When data is no longer required, it is securely deleted or anonymized.

              Legal obligations:
            </strong>

            <strong>
              Legitimate interests:

             We sometimes collect and use your personal data because we have a legitimate reason to use it and this is reasonable when balanced against your human rights and freedoms. Where we rely on legitimate interests, such interests include operating, securing, and improving the Platform and preventing fraud.

              Notice.
            </strong>
             This means that you can request that we disclose what personal information we have collected about you, including the categories of personal information, the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information, the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.

            <strong>
              Access.
            </strong>
             This means that you have the right to access your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Deletion.
            </strong>
             This means that you can request that we delete personal information about you which we have collected from you. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

              Erasure.

          <li>
            <strong>
              Object to Specific Processing.
            </strong>
             This means that you may object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Restrict Processing.

            <strong>
              Withdraw Consent.
            </strong>
             Where we are relying on consent to process your personal information, you may withdraw that consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

            <strong>
              Limit the Use or Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.
            </strong>
             The CCPA provides a right for consumers to request that business limit the use or disclosure of their “sensitive” personal information. In our normal business operations, we do not process sensitive personal information as that term is defined under CCPA. Please do not submit this information to us.

            <strong>
              Opt-Out of the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information.
            </strong>
             You may have the right to opt out of the “sale” or sharing of personal information with third parties for cross-contextual marketing purposes.
             
            <strong>
              We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” any personal information, including any personal information relating to consumers under the age of 16, as we understand those terms to be defined under applicable law.
