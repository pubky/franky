# ADR 0014: Muting System

## Status

Accepted — 2025-01-12

## Context

Users need the ability to hide content from specific accounts without unfollowing or blocking them. Muting should:
- Take effect immediately in the UI (local-first)
- Persist across sessions and sync to the homeserver
- Filter posts from muted users across all feed types
- Be easily reversible without the muted user knowing

## Decision

Implement a **user-based muting system** with three storage layers and integration with post stream filtering.

### Scope

Only **users** can be muted. The system does not currently support muting:
- Words or phrases
- Threads
- Hashtags
- Post content patterns

### Data Model

Mute state is stored in the `user_relationships` table alongside follow state:

```typescript
interface UserRelationshipsModelSchema {
  id: Pubky;              // The related user's ID
  following: boolean;
  followed_by: boolean;
  muted: boolean;         // Mute flag
}
```

### Storage Layers

1. **IndexedDB (Dexie)** — Source of truth for relationship state
   - Table: `user_relationships`
   - Indexed on: `id`, `following`, `followed_by`, `muted`

2. **User Stream Cache** — Fast access for filtering
   - Stream ID: `UserStreamTypes.MUTED`
   - Contains: Array of muted user Pubkeys
   - Updated on mute/unmute operations

3. **Settings Store (Zustand)** — UI state management
   - Persisted to local storage via Zustand middleware
   - Synced during bootstrap

### Mute Operations

```typescript
// Create mute
LocalMuteService.create({ muter, mutee })
// 1. Upsert UserRelationshipsModel with muted: true
// 2. Add mutee to MUTED stream

// Delete mute
LocalMuteService.delete({ muter, mutee })
// 1. Update UserRelationshipsModel with muted: false
// 2. Remove mutee from MUTED stream
```

### Homeserver Sync

Mutes sync to the homeserver for cross-device persistence:
- **URL Pattern**: `pubky://{muter}/pub/pubky.app/mutes/{mutee}`
- **Sequence**: Local database first (atomicity), then homeserver (durability)

### Post Filtering

Posts from muted users are filtered using the `MuteFilter` class:

```typescript
class MuteFilter {
  static filterPosts(postIds: string[], mutedUserIds: Set<Pubky>): string[] {
    return postIds.filter((postId) => {
      const { pubky: authorId } = parseCompositeId(postId);
      return !mutedUserIds.has(authorId);
    });
  }
}
```

### Deleted Post Filtering

Deleted posts (content === `Core.DELETED`) are also filtered from streams. This filtering:

1. **Chains with mute filtering**: Mute filter runs first (sync), then deleted filter (async)
2. **Fails open**: Posts without cached details are kept (avoids hiding valid posts)
3. **Applies in two flows**:
   - **Pagination (Flow 1)**: Filtered inside `PostStreamQueue.collect()` via async `FilterFn`
   - **"See new posts" (Flow 2)**: Filtered in `LocalStreamPostsService.mergeUnreadStreamWithPostStream()`

```typescript
// Deleted post filter (async - requires DB lookup)
async function filterDeletedPosts(postIds: string[]): Promise<string[]> {
  const validPosts: string[] = [];
  for (const postId of postIds) {
    const details = await PostDetailsModel.findById(postId);
    // Keep posts without details (fail-open) or with non-deleted content
    if (!details || details.content !== DELETED) {
      validPosts.push(postId);
    }
  }
  return validPosts;
}
```

Integration with post streams (combined filtering):

```typescript
// In PostStreamApplication.getOrFetchStreamSlice()
const mutedUserIds = await LocalStreamUsersService.findById(MUTED);
const { posts } = await postStreamQueue.collect(streamId, {
  filter: async (posts) => {
    // Sync: mute filter (O(1) Set lookup)
    const afterMuteFilter = MuteFilter.filterPosts(posts, mutedUserIds);
    // Async: deleted filter (DB read)
    return filterDeletedPosts(afterMuteFilter);
  },
  // ...
});
```

### UI Usage

**Muting a user** can be triggered from:
- User profile page (mute button/menu option)
- Post context menu (three-dot menu → "Mute user")

```typescript
// From a React component, use the controller layer:
import { UserController } from '@/core/controllers/user/user';

// Mute a user
await UserController.commitMute('mute', { muter: currentUserId, mutee: targetUserId });

// Unmute a user
await UserController.commitMute('unmute', { muter: currentUserId, mutee: targetUserId });
```

**Checking mute status** for UI display (e.g., showing "Muted" badge):

```typescript
import { UserApplication } from '@/core/application/user/user';

const relationship = await UserApplication.getRelationships({ userId: targetUserId });
const isMuted = relationship?.muted ?? false;
```

**Managing muted users** via settings:
- Navigate to `/settings/muted-users`
- Displays `MutedUsersList` component showing all muted users
- Each entry has an unmute action

```typescript
// Access muted users list from settings store
import { useSettingsStore } from '@/core/stores/settings/settings.store';

const mutedUsers = useSettingsStore((state) => state.muted);
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- Immediate UI feedback (local-first muting)
- Consistent filtering across all feed types
- Muted users are unaware they've been muted
- Easily reversible via settings UI

### Negative

- Only user-level muting (no keyword/hashtag muting)
- Muted users' posts still fetched from API (filtered client-side)
- Filter changes don't retroactively update already-rendered posts
- Deleted post filtering requires async DB lookups (slightly slower than sync mute filter)

### Neutral

- Requires PostStreamQueue for efficient filtered pagination
- Mute list loaded into memory for O(1) lookup during filtering
- Bootstrap must sync mutes before feeds render correctly
- Deleted post filtering uses fail-open strategy (posts without cached details are shown)

## Alternatives Considered

### Server-side muting

**Description**: Send mute list to API and have server filter posts.

**Pros**: Less data transfer, simpler client filtering

**Cons**: Exposes social graph to server, slower to update

**Why not chosen**: Violates local-first principles; mute changes should be instant.

### Keyword/Content-based muting

**Description**: Allow muting specific words, phrases, or hashtags.

**Pros**: More granular control, can hide topics not accounts

**Cons**: Requires content parsing, more complex filter logic

**Why not chosen**: Out of scope for initial implementation; user muting covers primary use case.

### Blocking instead of muting

**Description**: Combine muting with blocking (prevent interactions).

**Pros**: Stronger boundary, single concept

**Cons**: Different use case, muting is softer/reversible

**Why not chosen**: Muting and blocking serve different purposes; kept separate.

## Implementation Notes

- Mute service: `src/core/services/local/mute/mute.ts`

- Queue types: `src/core/application/stream/posts/muting/post-stream-queue.types.ts` (`FilterFn` async support)
- Relationships model: `src/core/models/user/relationships/userRelationships.ts`
