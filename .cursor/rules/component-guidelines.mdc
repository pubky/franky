# Component Guidelines

## Component Structure
1. Each component should be in its own file
2. Use TypeScript to define props and types
3. Use export default for the main component
4. Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility

## Structure Example
```typescript
import { FC } from 'react'

interface ComponentProps {
  // define props here
}

const Component: FC<ComponentProps> = ({ /* props */ }) => {
  return (
    // JSX here
  )
}

export default Component
```

## Best Practices
1. Use custom hooks for reusable logic
2. Keep state as local as possible
3. Use memo() only when needed for optimization
4. Document complex props with comments
5. Follow web accessibility principles
