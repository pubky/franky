# ADR 0009: Application Layer Cross-Domain Orchestration

## Status

Accepted — 2025-11-21

## Context

Complex user workflows often require coordinating operations across multiple domains. For example, creating a post with file attachments and tags involves three distinct domain operations:

1. **File upload** (FileApplication)
2. **Post creation** (PostApplication)
3. **Tag association** (TagApplication)

These operations must be orchestrated as a single cohesive workflow with proper ordering (files before post, post before tags) and transactional semantics.

Under the current architecture (ADR-0004), the allowed dependencies are:

```
UI → Controllers → Application → Services
```

This creates a design challenge:

- **Controllers can only call Application** (not other Controllers)
- **Application can only call Services** (no cross-Application calls documented)
- **No cross-domain orchestration layer exists**

This forces a choice between three unsatisfactory approaches:

1. **UI orchestration**: Have UI components coordinate multiple controller calls, leaking business logic into the presentation layer
2. **Duplication**: Duplicate file upload and tag creation logic inside PostApplication, violating DRY principles
3. **Service bypass**: Have controllers call services directly, bypassing the Application orchestration layer

None of these approaches align with clean architecture principles.

The fundamental issue: **Where does cross-domain orchestration belong?**

## Decision

**Allow Application layer classes to call other Application layer classes** for workflow orchestration, with the following constraints:

### Core Rules

1. **Horizontal calls permitted**: Application classes MAY call other Application classes within the same layer
2. **Acyclic dependency graph**: Circular dependencies between Application classes are FORBIDDEN
3. **Maximum call depth of 1**: If Application A calls Application B, then B MUST NOT call any other Application class within that execution flow
4. **Orchestration privilege**: ONLY `PostApplication` and `UserApplication` are permitted to call other Application classes. All other Application classes (FileApplication, TagApplication, BookmarkApplication, etc.) MUST NOT call other Application classes, including PostApplication or UserApplication. This ensures that core domain entities (posts and users) can orchestrate specialized domains, but specialized domains remain independent and cannot create reverse dependencies on core entities.

### Example

```typescript
// ✅ ALLOWED: PostApplication (orchestrator) calls helper applications
class PostApplication {
  static async createWithAttachments({ files, tags, post }) {
    // Depth 0 → Depth 1
    await FileApplication.upload(files); // OK (PostApplication can call others)
    await PostApplication.create(post); // OK (same class)
    await TagApplication.commitCreate(tags); // OK (PostApplication can call others)
  }
}

// ✅ ALLOWED: UserApplication (orchestrator) calls helper applications
class UserApplication {
  static async createWithProfile({ user, avatar }) {
    await FileApplication.upload([avatar]); // OK (UserApplication can call others)
    await UserApplication.create(user); // OK (same class)
  }
}

// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Specialized applications cannot call other applications
class FileApplication {
  static async upload(files) {
    // NOT ALLOWED: FileApplication cannot call other Application classes
    await TagApplication.commitCreate(tags); // ❌ VIOLATION
    await PostApplication.validate(); // ❌ VIOLATION
    await UserApplication.getProfile(); // ❌ VIOLATION
  }
}

// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Specialized applications cannot call PostApplication or UserApplication
class TagApplication {
  static async create(tag) {
    await PostApplication.getById(tag.postId); // ❌ VIOLATION
    await UserApplication.getById(tag.userId); // ❌ VIOLATION
  }
}

// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Deep chains (even from orchestrators)
class PostApplication {
  static async createWithAttachments({ files, tags, post }) {
    await FileApplication.upload(files); // OK (Depth 0 → 1)
  }
}
class FileApplication {
  static async upload(files) {
    // Depth 1 → Depth 2 (violates max depth rule)
    await ImageProcessorApplication.process(); // ❌ NOT ALLOWED (also violates rule 4)
  }
}

// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Circular dependencies
class PostApplication {
  static async create() {
    await FileApplication.upload(); // A → B
  }
}
class FileApplication {
  static async upload() {
    await PostApplication.validate(); // B → A (circular! also violates rule 4)
  }
}
```

### Enforcement Strategy

⚠️ **Critical Limitation**: Our architecture uses **static classes without dependency injection**. Therefore:

- ✅ Dependencies are explicit in code (searchable)
- ❌ Dependencies are NOT visible in type signatures
- ❌ Circular dependencies are NOT caught at compile time
- ❌ Call depth is NOT enforced by TypeScript

**We rely on:**

1. **Code Reviews**: Reviewers MUST check for:
   - Circular dependencies
   - Excessive call depth (max depth 1)
   - **Orchestration privilege violations** (only PostApplication/UserApplication can call other Applications)
2. **Documentation**: This ADR as the source of truth
3. **Testing**: Integration tests to catch violations at runtime
4. **Code Comments**: Developers MUST document cross-Application calls with ADR reference

**Future Tooling** (optional, not required now):

- dependency-cruiser for circular dependency detection
- Custom ESLint rules for call depth validation
- Type-level dependency tracking (TypeScript 5.x features)

### Guidelines for Use

**When TO use cross-Application calls:**

- ✅ Single user action requires multi-domain coordination
- ✅ Complex workflow with ordering/transactional requirements
- ✅ Avoiding code duplication of orchestration logic
- ✅ **Only from PostApplication or UserApplication** (core domain orchestrators)

**When NOT to use:**

- ❌ Simple read operations (use services directly)
- ❌ Single-domain workflows (stay within one Application)
- ❌ Deep processing chains (refactor to flatten)
- ❌ **From specialized Application classes** (FileApplication, TagApplication, BookmarkApplication, etc.) - these must remain independent and cannot depend on PostApplication or UserApplication

## Consequences

### Positive ✅

- **Proper orchestration location**: Cross-domain workflows stay in Application layer (not UI, not Services)
- **Code reuse**: Avoid duplicating file upload, tag creation logic across Application classes
- **Single responsibility preserved**: Each Application class maintains its domain focus
- **Testability**: Can mock cross-Application dependencies in unit tests
- **Matches orchestration role**: Application layer is ALREADY responsible for orchestrating services; this extends to orchestrating other applications

### Negative ❌

- **Increased coupling**: Application classes now depend on each other
- **Hidden dependencies**: Static classes don't declare dependencies in signatures
- **Review burden**: Code reviewers must manually verify architectural constraints
- **Testing complexity**: More mocking required (mock cross-Application calls)

### Neutral ⚠️

- **Requires discipline**: Team must enforce rules through reviews and testing
- **Documentation-heavy**: Constraints live in docs, not code
- **Potential for misuse**: Easy to create deep chains or circular dependencies if not careful
- **Future refactor possible**: Could move to dependency injection later for compile-time enforcement

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Full Dependency Injection Refactor

**Description**: Move from static classes to instance-based classes with constructor injection.

```typescript
class PostApplication {
  constructor(
    private fileApp: FileApplication,
    private tagApp: TagApplication,
    private postService: LocalPostService,
  ) {}

  async create({ files, tags, post }) {
    await this.fileApp.upload(files);
    await this.tagApp.create(tags);
  }
}
```

**Pros**:

- Explicit dependencies in constructor
- Compile-time circular dependency detection (would fail instantiation)
- Better testability (easier mocking)
- Could enforce call depth with types
- Industry standard pattern

**Cons**:

- **Massive refactor** (affects every Controller, Application, Service)
- Need DI container or manual wiring
- Increased boilerplate
- Initialization complexity
- Team learning curve
- No immediate business value

**Why not chosen**: The refactor scope is too large for the immediate problem. This could be reconsidered later if:

- Architecture violations become frequent
- Team size grows beyond effective code review capacity
- Complexity requires stronger compile-time guarantees

### Alternative 2: UI Orchestration

**Description**: Have UI components coordinate multiple controller calls sequentially.

```typescript
// In React component
const handlePostCreate = async () => {
  const fileUrls = await Promise.all(files.map((f) => FileController.upload({ file: f, pubky })));
  await PostController.create({ content, fileUrls });
  await Promise.all(tags.map((tag) => TagController.commitCreate({ taggedId: postId, label: tag })));
};
```

**Pros**:

- No architecture changes needed
- Clear separation between domains
- Easy to understand flow

**Cons**:

- Business logic leaks into UI layer
- Orchestration logic scattered across components
- Hard to test (requires UI component testing)
- Error handling becomes complex
- Violates separation of concerns

**Why not chosen**: Business logic belongs in the domain layer, not presentation layer. This approach makes the UI responsible for orchestration, which is not its role.

### Alternative 3: Duplicate Orchestration Logic

**Description**: Each Application class duplicates the logic of other applications it needs.

```typescript
class PostApplication {
  static async create({ files, tags, post }) {
    // Duplicate FileApplication.upload logic
    for (const file of files) {
      await HomeserverService.putBlob(...);
      await HomeserverService.request(...);
      await LocalFileService.create(...);
    }

    // Duplicate TagApplication.create logic
    for (const tag of tags) {
      await LocalPostTagService.create(...);
      await HomeserverService.request(...);
    }

    // Post creation logic
    await LocalPostService.create(...);
  }
}
```

**Pros**:

- No cross-Application dependencies
- Each Application fully independent
- Easy to reason about (all logic in one place)

**Cons**:

- Violates DRY principle (logic duplicated 2-3x)
- Hard to maintain (changes needed in multiple places)
- Inconsistency risk (different implementations drift)
- Increased bug surface area
- Code bloat

**Why not chosen**: The maintenance burden and inconsistency risk outweigh the benefits of independence. Orchestration logic should be reusable.
